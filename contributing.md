 # Contribution Guidelines


 ## Bug Reports

 * Please answer the following questions:
     * How can the issue be reproduced?
     * What version of exoskeleton are you using and how did you install it?
     * Which python version do you use?


 ## Code Contributions

 Code Contributions are welcome. Before you spend a lot of time programming
 please check the issue's page or get in contact. It is a design goal to avoid
 bloat by implementing too many features.

 * Please adhere to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
 * The code should include documentation.
 * Variable names should be speaking.
 * The code uses type-annotations. Part of the built is an automatic run of mypy.
